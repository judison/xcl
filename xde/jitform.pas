  Abstract:
    JITForm - just-in-time form.
    Forms are the most common resources/design items in the IDE, hence the name.
    Of course any TComponent descendant can be editid but naming it
    'JITComponent' would confuse new developers.

    Because the IDE does wild things with forms and datamodules, like creating
    an own class for each opened form/datamodule and dynamically creating
    methods for it, you can't use some special compiling modes like -pg (gprof)
    with this unit.
    Therefore this unit is kept in a directory of its own.
